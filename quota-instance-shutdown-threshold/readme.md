Efficiently Managing Linode Instances: Gradual Shutdowns Driven by Network Traffic Usage Thresholds via Python and Linode API scripting


Problem Statement
Managing resource allocation efficiently is crucial to ensure optimal performance and cost-effectiveness. Linode instances may experience periods of high network traffic that can lead to increased operational costs or potential service degradation with traffic allowance given by each instances. A need exists for a system that can monitor network traffic usage and initiate a gradual shutdown of instances when traffic exceeds predefined thresholds, thereby conserving resources and reducing costs without overage the transfer allowance provided by the instances.

Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a Python script utilizing the Linode API to monitor network traffic usage on Linode instances. The script will implement a controlled, gradual shutdown process for instances when their network usage exceeds specified thresholds, thereby ensuring efficient resource management while minimizing service interruptions.

Prerequisites:
1. Prepare Linode API Token Credentials 

Step to implement:
1. Prepared all the dependencies mentioned above.
2. Modify the API token and other information from the script based on your need.
3. Setup the cron task scheduler to execute the script (every 1 minutes)
    Eg command cron command for every 2 minutes: */2 * * * * /path_location/python3 taint.py
